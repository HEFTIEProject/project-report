# HEFTIE final report

This is the final report for the [Handling Enourmous Files from Tomography Imaging Experiments (HEFTIE) project](https://oscars-project.eu/projects/heftie-handling-enormous-files-tomographic-imaging-experiments), an EU funded project to improve tools and educational resources for handling huge imaging datasets.
We hope these new resources will accelerate the analysis of 3D organ scans and unlock discoveries in the life sciences, benefiting also other fields, such as neuroscience, archaeology, and the earth sciences.

## Digital textbook

We created a new digital textbook, called [Handling Enormous Files from 3D Imaging Experiments](https://heftie-textbook.readthedocs.io/).
This textbook gives scientists:

- an introduction to the motivation and theory behind chunked datasets
- a practical introduction to creating chunked datasets, and the configuration options available
- a guide to designing parallel processing algorithms to work efficiently with chunked datasets
- a guide to exporting chunked datasets to other 'tradditional' datasets

## Tools for working with chunked datasets

## Improvements to cloud visualisation
