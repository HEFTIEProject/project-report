# HEFTIE final report

This is the final report for the [Handling Enourmous Files from Tomography Imaging Experiments (HEFTIE) project](https://oscars-project.eu/projects/heftie-handling-enormous-files-tomographic-imaging-experiments), an EU funded project to improve tools and educational resources for handling huge imaging datasets.
We hope these new resources will accelerate the analysis of 3D organ scans and unlock discoveries in the life sciences, benefiting also other fields, such as neuroscience, archaeology, and the earth sciences.
